## Projects ##
A description of each project that can be found in this repository.

### Antilli ###
A 3D model viewer that utilizes WPF and supports loading Driv3r models. Includes a tool for editing chunk files.

### DSCript ###
The framework that holds everything together. Mostly contains code for working with game file formats. Name subject to change.

### GMC2Snooper ###
Experimental PS2 model loading tool. Once it's finished, the final changes will be merged into DSCript and Antilli.

### IMGRipper ###
Tool for working with PS2/XBox .IMG files used in games such as Stuntman, Driv3r, and Driver: Parallel Lines. Also includes rudimentary support for Driver '76 (PSP). This actually doesn't need to be in this repository, I just haven't gotten around to moving it.

### LocSF ###
Experimental tool for working with locale files in Driver: San Francisco. Doesn't do much at the moment.

### LuaSF ###
Allows for working with compiled script files in Driver: San Francisco. Requires my .NET port of a popular Lua 5.1 decompiler, [Unluac.NET](https://bitbucket.org/Fireboyd78/unluacnet).

### Zartex ###
Experimental tool for working with mission files in Driv3r. **ZartexV2** is unofficially the WPF port of the original WinForms version.
